    "We will be looking into Car Features and how it will affect the MSRP of the cars. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was from kaggle [Car Features and MSRP](https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/cardataset) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a description of the data was not given. Let us list out the features and their details <br>\n",
    "  - __Car Make__\n",
    "      * Brand of the vehicle\n",
    "  - __Car Model__\n",
    "      * Can also be \"Name\" of car\n",
    "  - __Car Year__\n",
    "      * When the car was manufactured\n",
    "  - __Engine Fuel Type__\n",
    "      * Fuel type reccomendation for the car. If it is an electric vehicle \"electric\" will be shown.\n",
    "  - __Engine Hourse Power(HP)__\n",
    "      * Refers to the power an engine produces\n",
    "  - __Engine Cylinders__\n",
    "      * Cylinders are located in an engine, it is  a chamber where fuel is combusted and power is generated. In this data, it refers to the amount of cylinders the Engine has.\n",
    "  - __Transimission Type__\n",
    "      * The way power is transmitted from an engine to the axle in the vehicle\n",
    "  - __Driven Wheels__\n",
    "      * Different Vehicles run on different wheel drives. Front wheel drive cars will have power transmitted to the Front 2 wheels. Rear wheel drive cars will have power transmitted to the Rear 2 wheels. All wheel drive cars will have power transmitted to all the Wheels all the time. 4WD is similar to All wheel drive cars, just with the fact that it can toggle between 4WD and 2WD. \n",
    "  - __Number of Doors__\n",
    "      * Self explanatory\n",
    "  - __Market Category__\n",

    "      * Refers to their body style, We are familiar with cars without roofs (Convertible), normal cars (Sedans) and many more\n",
    "  - __Highway MPG__\n",
    "      * Refers to Miles Per Gallons, and it is used to show how far the car can travel for every gallon on an highway. (Travelling on highway does not require the car to Stop and Accelerate constantly. Therefore will usually result in Higher MPG compared to City MPG)\n",
    "  - __City MPG__\n",
    "      * Similar to Highway MPG, but shows how far the car travels for every gallon in the City.\n",
    "  - __Popularity__\n",
    "      * Data was scraped from twitter polls to indicate the popularity of the car.\n",
    "  - __MSRP__\n",
    "      * Refers to the manufacturer's suggested retail price\n",
