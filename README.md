## Introduction
<a id = "Intro"></a>
This is SC16 Group 6's take on our Mini Project for SC1015 which explores the data set of [SGcarmart Prediction](https://github.com/xianjinseow92/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Project_2_SgCarMart%20Price%20Prediction/notebooks/sgcarmart_used_cars_prices.csv)

## Problem Definition
<a id = "Problem"></a>
Buying a car in Singapore is infamous for its high cost, yet its every Singaporeans' dream to own one and avoid squeezing into public transport. So, this lead our team to formulate this question:
#### > How do we as a buyer, decide if a car purchase is worth it and get the biggest bang for our buck? 

## Data Set and Preparation
<a id = "Data"></a>
Through a lot of discussion, our team went through multiple data sets before settling on [This Dataset on GitHub](https://github.com/xianjinseow92/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Project_2_SgCarMart%20Price%20Prediction/notebooks/sgcarmart_used_cars_prices.csv) that conforms with what we wanted to discover.

This Dataset is interesting as it gives a Singaporean context. To illustrate, ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87572499/164482835-26a3ef01-c95a-44aa-832a-54e0eb8f5b1f.png)

As car prices are exorbitant in Singapore comapred to the other countries. It is a good idea to stick to Singapore only.
