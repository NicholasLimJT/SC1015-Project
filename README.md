## Problem Definition
<a id = "Problem"></a>
Buying a car in Singapore is infamous for its high cost, yet its every Singaporeans' dream to own one and avoid squeezing into public transport. So, this lead our team to the question:
#### > How do we as a buyer, decide if a car purchase is worth it and get the biggest bang for our buck?

## Data Set and Preparation
